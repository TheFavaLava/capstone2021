## Summary
The Production Environment has been setup to establish a secure separation from server side and client functionality, and ensure requests are being received securely and asynchronously.

## Description
Nginx and Gunicorn have been implemented to provide efficient load balancing and asynchronous server connections from multiple clients.


The Vagrant File is designed to automatically create an instance of a virtual machine on the Capstone2021 Virtual Box.


Check the [Vagrant.md](https://github.com/cs334s21/capstone2021/blob/main/docs/vagrant.md) file for complete details involving how the VagrantFile is setup and used.
